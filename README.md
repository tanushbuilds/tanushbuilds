### Hey there! 👋

I'm 14 and learning **Game Development**, focusing on **Unity and C#** through small projects.

Currently, I'm building a **psychological horror game**, applying design, mechanics, and problem-solving skills.

I have experience with **Django**, giving me a foundation in backend development, and I'm exploring **introductory machine learning concepts**.

I mainly use **Unity, C#, and Git & GitHub** for my projects.

Outside tech, I play **tennis**, which keeps me disciplined and focused.
