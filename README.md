### Hey there! 👋

I'm 14 and learning **Game Development**, focusing on **Unity and C#**.  

Currently building a **psychological horror game** to apply design, mechanics, and problem-solving skills.  

Experienced with **Django**, with a foundation in backend development, and exploring **introductory machine learning concepts**.  

### Tools I use:

- Unity
- C#
- Git
- GitHub  

Outside tech, I play **tennis**, which keeps me disciplined and focused.
