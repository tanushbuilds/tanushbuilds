### Hey there! 👋

I'm 14 and currently learning **Game Development** 🎮. I enjoy building small projects and understanding how things work behind the scenes, especially when it comes to game mechanics and programming fundamentals.

My main focus is game development using **Unity and C#**, where I spend time experimenting, learning, and improving step by step. In the past, I’ve also worked with **Django** while exploring web development, which helped me understand backend concepts and structured programming.

Alongside game development, I’m currently exploring **introductory machine learning concepts** and expanding my general technical knowledge. I mainly work with **Unity, C#, and Git & GitHub** to manage and build my projects.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing **tennis**, which helps me stay active and balanced.
