### Hey there! 👋

I'm 14 and currently focused on learning **Game Development**. I work on small projects to develop a deeper understanding of game mechanics and core programming concepts.

My primary focus is game development using **Unity and C#**, where I consistently experiment, learn, and improve through hands-on practice. 

I am also currently building a **psychological horror game**, which allows me to apply design principles, gameplay mechanics, and technical problem-solving in a practical project. 

Previously, I worked with **Django** during my exploration of web development, which helped build a foundation in backend development and structured programming.

In addition to game development, I am exploring **introductory machine learning concepts** to broaden my technical knowledge. I primarily use **Unity, C#, and Git & GitHub** for building and managing projects.

Outside of technology, I play **tennis**, which helps maintain discipline, focus, and balance.
